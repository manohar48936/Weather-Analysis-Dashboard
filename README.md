## 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis and visualization of global weather data** to extract actionable insights, trends, and patterns. It empowers users to understand temperature fluctuations, humidity levels, pressure variations, and other meteorological factors in an interactive and simplified way.

---

## 📚 Project Description

The **Weather Forecasting Analysis and Visualization Project** involves:

- Collecting real-world weather data for multiple cities worldwide.
- Cleaning, processing, and analysing the data to identify trends.
- Building interactive visualizations and dashboards to present these insights to users in a clear and effective manner.

The primary goal is to enable **quick and meaningful understanding of weather patterns for informed decision-making**.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Weather data is often available in raw numerical formats, making it challenging for decision-makers to interpret and act upon it efficiently. This project addresses:

- Lack of **visual clarity** in weather reports.
- Difficulty in identifying trends across time periods or locations.
- The need for interactive dashboards that provide **dynamic filtering, comparison, and storytelling**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✔️ Clean and preprocess raw weather datasets for analysis.  
✔️ Perform descriptive and comparative data analysis.  
✔️ Build interactive dashboards to visualize weather trends effectively.  
✔️ Extract key insights for academic, business, or daily life decision-making.

---

## 🔗 Data Source

The dataset used for this project includes weather details such as:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Pressure**
- **Wind Speed**
- **Visibility**

_Data sourced from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) APIs and publicly available CSV datasets._

## ⚙️ Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering weather data from APIs and CSV files.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing null values, duplicates, and outliers using Python (Pandas).  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzing data distribution, trends, and correlations.  
4. **Visualization:** Creating interactive dashboards using Power BI to present insights.  
5. **Reporting:** Documenting key findings and possible interpretations.
